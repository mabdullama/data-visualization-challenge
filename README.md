Cancer Treatment Study Analysis

Welcome to the Cancer Treatment Study Analysis repository! This repository contains code and data for analyzing a study on different drug regimens for the treatment of cancer. The study focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of various treatments and understanding key insights from the data.

Study Overview

The study analyzed the data from a cancer treatment experiment conducted on mice. The experiment involved administering different drug regimens to mice with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumors. The goal was to compare the effectiveness of specific drug regimens in treating the tumors.

Repository Contents

*This directory contains the dataset required for the analysis. It includes two CSV files: Mouse_metadata.csv (mouse metadata) and Study_results.csv (study results).
*pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the code for the analysis. It combines the study data, cleans it by removing duplicates, calculates summary statistics, creates bar and pie charts, generates box plots, line plots, and scatter plots, and performs correlation analysis and linear regression.
*README.md: You are currently reading the README file, which provides an overview of the repository and instructions for using the code.

Conclusion

This repository provides the necessary code and data to analyze the Cancer Treatment Study. By running the Jupyter Notebook pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb, you can reproduce the study's analysis and gain insights into the effectiveness of different drug regimens for cancer treatment. We encourage you to explore the results further, validate the findings, and contribute to advancing cancer research.
